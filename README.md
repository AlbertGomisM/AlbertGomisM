### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Developer interested in everything related to development, technology and the knowledge derived from it. Due to my studies and background, I am also attracted to everything related to economics, business and how these two disciplines coexist and evolve with the current exponential development of technology.
